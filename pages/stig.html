            <p> <b>The Stig</b> is a character on the British motoring television show Top Gear. The Stig's primary role is setting lap times for cars tested on the show, as well as instructing celebrity guests, off-camera, for the show's &quot;Star in a Reasonably Priced Car&quot; segment. The character is a play on the anonymity of racing drivers' full-face helmets, with the running joke that nobody knows who, or indeed what, is inside the Stig's racing suit.
            </p>
            <p>
                The identity of the original &quot;Black&quot; Stig, Perry McCarthy, was exposed by a Sunday newspaper in January 2003, and confirmed by McCarthy later that year. The black-suited Stig was subsequently &quot;killed off&quot; that October in the series 3 premiere, and replaced in the following episode by a new White Stig who lasted through to the end of series 15. In series 13, the show jokingly unmasked the Stig as seven-time world champion F1 driver Michael Schumacher. In the hiatus following series 15, racing driver Ben Collins was revealed to be the Stig in a court battle over Collins' impending autobiography, titled The Man in the White Suit. In series 16, debuting in December 2010, Collins was replaced by a second White Stig, whose identity has so far remained secret.

            <h2>Some say that ...</h2>
            <p>
                The Stig's introductions on the show have underlined his oddness. Initially the presenters heralded his appearance with simple humorous introductions, such as &quot;His Holiness, the Stig!&quot;. Beginning in series 6, the introductions began to follow a format of, &quot;Some say that [two bizarre characteristics]. All we know is, he's called the Stig.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>Some of the introductions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    &ldquo;Some say his droppings have been found as far north as York, and that he has a full size tattoo of his face, on his face. All we know is he&rsquo;s called the Stig.&rdquo;
                </li>
                <li>
                    &ldquo;Some say it&rsquo;s impossible for him to wear socks, and he can open a beer bottle with his testes. All we know is he&rsquo;s called the Stig.&rdquo;
                </li>
                <li>
                    &ldquo;Some say that on really warm days he sheds his skin like a snake, and that for some reason he&rsquo;s allergic to the Dutch. All we know is he&rsquo;s called the Stig.&rdquo;
                </li>
                <li>
                    &ldquo;Some say he isn&rsquo;t machine washable, and all his potted plants are called &lsquo;Steve&rsquo;. All we know is he&rsquo;s called the Stig.&rdquo;
                </li>
                <li>
                    &ldquo;Some say that he has to take his shoes off with an allen key, and that his new year&rsquo;s resolution is to eat fewer mice. All we know is he&rsquo;s called the Stig.&rdquo;
                </li>
