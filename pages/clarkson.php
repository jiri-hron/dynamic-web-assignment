            <p> <b>Jeremy Charles Robert Clarkson</b> (born April 11, 1960) is an English broadcaster and writer who specialises in motoring.
            </p>
            <p>
                He writes weekly columns for The Sunday Times and The Sun, but is better known for his role on the BBC TV show Top Gear.
            </p>
            <p>
                &quot;Not a man given to considered opinion,&quot; according to the BBC, Clarkson is known to be opinionated and forthright in his views. The Economist, on the subject of road pricing in UK, has described him as a &quot;skilful propagandist for the motoring lobby&quot;.
            </p>
            <p>
                Born in Doncaster, Clarkson was educated at Repton School, although he claims to have been expelled. His first job was as a travelling salesman for his parents' business selling Paddington Bear toys, after which he trained as a journalist with the Rotherham Advertiser.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2004 during an episode of the BBC's Who Do You Think You Are?, Clarkson was invited to investigate his family history; including the story of his great-great-great grandfather John Kilner (1792-1857), who invented the Kilner jar; a receptacle for preserved fruit.
            </p>
            <p>
                In spite of his penchant for fast driving and high performance cars, Clarkson has been reported as having a clean licence. Nonetheless, he is not reluctant to discuss driving fast: In a November 2005 article in The Sunday Times, Clarkson wrote, while discussing the Bugatti Veyron, &quot;On a recent drive across Europe I desperately wanted to reach the top speed but I ran out of road when the needle hit 240mph&quot;, and later, in the same article,&quot;From the wheel of a Veyron, France is the size of a small coconut. I cannot tell you how fast I crossed it the other day. Because you simply wouldn't believe me&quot;.
            </p>

                    Speed has never killed anyone, suddenly becoming stationary... That's what gets you.

                    A turbo, exhaust gasses go into the turbocharger and spin it, with a supercharger, air goes in,witchcraft happens and you go faster.

                    I'd like to consider Ferrari as a scaled down version of God.

                    I'd rather go to work on my hands and knees than drive there in a Ford Galaxy; Whoever designed the Ford Galaxy upholstery had a cauliflower fixation; I would rather have a vasectomy than buy a Ford Galaxy.

                    Owning a TVR in the past was like owning a bear, I mean it was great, until it pulled your head off, which it would.
